# Warcry Manager  
**V1.1**  
**Quite a few bugs have been squished**

Keeping track of your warcries in 'alias .warcries' can be a bit of a pain, let alone adding new warcries to the list or editing them.  
This little plugin takes some of the faff out of all that and makes it simpler to managed your warcries.  

To start type in "Warcry Update" to pull your .warcries into the plugin.  
From there you can:  
"Warcry Add [warcry message]" to add a new warcry  
"Warcry delete [warcry number]" to remove a warcry you no longer want  
"Warcry Edit [warcry number] [warcry message]" to change on of your warcries (handy if you're good at making typos)  
"Warcry Help" will give you a list of commands in-game

**Make sure you have 'alias .warcries' in-game before you try to use the plugin**.
